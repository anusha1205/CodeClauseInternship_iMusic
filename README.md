# CodeClauseInternship_iMusic
iMusic is a testament to the power of web technologies. It encapsulates my passion for both music and coding. The aim was to simulate a music player interface, complete with buttons for backward, forward, play, and pause functionalities.
1. HTML organizes the content and layout of the webpage. It defines the buttons (backward, forward, play, pause) and creates the overall layout of the interface.
2. CSS is responsible for styling the buttons, adjusting colors, sizes, and positions to create an appealing interface. For instance, it might employ classes or IDs to target specific buttons for styling.

Event Handling: JavaScript likely includes event listeners to detect when the user interacts with the play and pause buttons. These listeners trigger functions that control the playback of music.
Play & Pause Functionality: Functions written in JavaScript would control the play and pause actions. Upon clicking the respective buttons, JavaScript might toggle the state of the music playback.

Future Functionality: Although the backward and forward buttons might not be fully functional yet, JavaScript could be used to outline the structure and prepare the functionality for these buttons. Functions might be created to handle skipping forward or backward in the music playback once they are fully integrated.
